# dynamic-rythms
This is a repo focused to solve the dynamic-rythms contest.

## Contest Summary

### Objective
Create a model that can forecast future weather impacts on power outages.

### Data
 Two public datasets are provided to help you get started and run the provided
 Starter notebook. 
 - The first dataset includes power outages in the U.S. from 2014 to 2023, containing information on the number of customers without power every 15 minutes at the county level 
 - The second dataset covers storm events in the U.S. from 2014 to 2024, compiled from NOAA’s storm event database. This is a subset of a larger dataset available via NOAA’s storm events database website.
 - We are not limited to the provided datasets.

### Evaluation
We are responsible of the train, test and hold-out splits, as well as creating custom metrics and evaluation scripts.
Good models have the following trais: Wether, and where, an outage ocurrs, and prediction should be sufficiently early to allow the measure.
Moreover the severity and duration is essential for assessing potential impacts. 

### Considerations
Data Handling & Preprocessing (20%):
Feature Engineering & Justification (15%):
Model Development & Performance (40%):
Interpretability & Insights (15%):
Solution Clarity & Reproducibility (10%):

### Essentials
- Jupyter Notebook: Your notebook will be written in Python and clearly outline the steps in your pipeline
- Requirements.txt file: This file will provide all required packages we need to run the training and inference for your submission
- Supplemental data or code: Include any additional data, scripts, or code that are necessary to accurately reproduce your results, please do not include the data we provided you
- Model Checkpoints (If applicable): Include model checkpoints created during training so we can replicate your results
- Software License: An open-source license to accompany your code

## Important dates:
Open feb 5, 2025. Closes May 1, 2025. Winners Announcement: 13 june 2025.
